# Intro

This project intentially desgned to show briefly Animation in Tabs and a simple theme.

I wrote a simple e2e test scenario which test cases can be added to it later. it needs karma and protractor server to be installed on local machine.

I wanted to simulate 2 modes mannaul and automatic so I created a tab for a variable room with variable light bulbs and a room with 100 light bulbs which 100 people enter than room later. I know this was necessary based on description but I added to show how BehaviorSubject works. in addition to that it will display smooth materla animation.

The web page is very simple. I did not add any style or custom theme.
