# Intro

This project intentially designed to show briefly Animation in Tabs and a simple theme.

I wrote a simple e2e test scenario which test cases can be added to it later. It needs karma and protractor server to be installed on local machine.

I wanted to simulate 2 modes, manual and automatic. I created a tab for a variable room with variable light bulbs as well as a room with  100 fixed light bulbs. 100 people will enter that room later. I know this was not necessary based on description, but I added it to show how BehaviorSubject works. Additionaly, it will display a smooth material animation.

The web page is very simple. I did not add any style or custom theme.

Since this is a very small project, I have not enabled lazy loading, meaning there's no additional modules beyond Material Module. However, I created nested folders (i.e. home/room) and placed UI components in there. In future, we can add their own modules to the folder if needed.
